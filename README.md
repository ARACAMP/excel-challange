
KICKSTART PROJECT

BACKGROUND 
Over 300,000 projects launched on Kickstarter, only a third have made it through the funding process with a positive outcome. With a successful crowdfunding service over two billion dollars have been raised with the Kickstarter. While 2185 of the projects was successfully funded, but an important number of projects were failed or cancelled.
Since getting funded on Kickstarter requires meeting or exceeding the project's initial goal, many organizations spend months looking through past projects in an attempt to discover some trick to finding success. Organized and analyzed a database of four thousand past projects in order to uncover any hidden trends.
THREE CONCLUSIONS OF THE DATA ANALYSIS
•	Theater was the most dominating category of the project launched and succeeded. It was followed by music and film & video. Journalism, food, games, photography and publishing consequently was less successful and received less attention. 
•	When we look at the subcategory statistics, we observed plays were constituting the most launched and most popular subcategory. Rock, documentaries, indie rock, and hard were significant sub categories. Artbook, audio, gadgets, nature, people, and restaurants were less represented and less funded projects. 
•	There is a decline in the success rate for all the campaigns from the from May till September and after that it starts increasing and is almost constant for the month of October and November. Looking at the chart for Goal vs percentage of outcome, we can conclude that the most successful Kickstarter Campaigns had a goal of up to 10,000.
LIMITATIONS WITH DATASET
Currency conversion was not done. It may not reflect the precise comparisons. 
This dataset includes a vast diverse types of categories and sub-categories. Instead of focusing on various categories & sub-categories, like film & video, technology, etc., if we focus on only few related categories, the analysis would be more easy and meaningful.
OTHER POSSIBLE ANALYSIS
A comparison table with the goals and pledged amount could be done. Regression analysis could be run to observe the correlation between them.
